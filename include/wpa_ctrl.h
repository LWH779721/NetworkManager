/**
 * wpaCtrlOpen - Open a control interface to wpa_supplicant/hostapd
 * @ctrl_path: Path for UNIX domain sockets; ignored if UDP sockets are used.
 * Returns: Pointer to abstract control interface data or %NULL on failure
 *
 * This function is used to open a control interface to wpa_supplicant/hostapd.
 * ctrl_path is usually /var/run/wpa_supplicant or /var/run/hostapd. This path
 * is configured in wpa_supplicant/hostapd and other programs using the control
 * interface need to use matching path configuration.

/**
 * wpaCtrlRequest - Send a command to wpa_supplicant/hostapd
 * @ctrl: Control interface data from wpaCtrlOpen()
 * @cmd: Command; usually, ASCII text, e.g., "PING"
 * @cmd_len: Length of the cmd in bytes
 * @reply: Buffer for the response
 * @reply_len: Reply buffer length
 * @msg_cb: Callback function for unsolicited messages or %NULL if not used
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error (send or receive failed), -2 on timeout
 *
 * This function is used to send commands to wpa_supplicant/hostapd. Received
 * response will be written to reply and reply_len is set to the actual length
 * of the reply. This function will block for up to two seconds while waiting
 * for the reply. If unsolicited messages are received, the blocking time may
 * be longer.
 *
 * msg_cb can be used to register a callback function that will be called for
 * unsolicited messages received while waiting for the command response. These
 * messages may be received if wpaCtrlRequest() is called at the same time as
 * wpa_supplicant/hostapd is sending such a message. This can happen only if
 * the program has used wpaCtrlAttach() to register itself as a monitor for
 * event messages. Alternatively to msg_cb, programs can register two control
 * interface connections and use one of them for commands and the other one for
 * receiving event messages, in other words, call wpaCtrlAttach() only for
 * the control interface connection that will be used for event messages.

 * wpa_supplicant/hostapd events. After a success wpaCtrlAttach() call, the
 * control interface connection starts receiving event messages that can be
 * read with wpaCtrlRecv().

 *
 * This function will receive a pending control interface message. This
 * function will block if no messages are available. The received response will
 * be written to reply and reply_len is set to the actual length of the reply.
 * wpaCtrlRecv() is only used for event messages, i.e., wpaCtrlAttach()

 * message available to be received with wpaCtrlRecv(). wpaCtrlPending() is
 * only used for event messages, i.e., wpaCtrlAttach() must have been used to
 * register the control interface as an event monitor.

/**
 * wpaCtrlGetFd - Get file descriptor used by the control interface
 * @ctrl: Control interface data from wpaCtrlOpen()
 * Returns: File descriptor used for the connection
 *
 * This function can be used to get the file descriptor that is used for the
 * control interface connection. The returned value can be used, e.g., with
 * select() while waiting for multiple events.
 *
 * The returned file descriptor must not be used directly for sending or
 * receiving packets; instead, the library functions wpaCtrlRequest() and
 * wpaCtrlRecv() must be used for this.
